# Considerations for EDC System Selection

## Key Factors in EDC Decision-Making

Investigators evaluating EDC systems typically consider several factors:

**Infrastructure dependencies**: Vendor-managed systems require ongoing vendor availability and support. System continuity depends on the vendor's business model and support commitments.

**Data format and portability**: Proprietary data formats can complicate long-term data stewardship, archival, and integration with analysis tools. Standard formats (SQL, CSV) facilitate data migration and re-use.

**Customization flexibility**: Some EDC systems limit customization of validation rules, reports, and workflows. Customization needs should be weighed against available support resources.

**Data control and access**: Vendor-managed systems store data on vendor infrastructure with limited investigator control over backup locations, residency, or access procedures. Investigator-managed systems require local infrastructure management.

**Cost structure**: Commercial EDC licensing typically involves per-patient fees or annual licensing costs that increase with study scale. Fixed infrastructure costs remain constant regardless of enrollment.

## Scenarios Motivating Alternative Approaches

Investigators sometimes pursue alternative EDC approaches in specific situations:

**Cost sensitivity**: Studies with limited budgets or long enrollment timelines may find annual licensing fees prohibitive relative to per-patient recruitment budgets.

**Customization needs**: Studies requiring non-standard validation rules or integration with specific analysis tools may find commercial EDC constraints limiting.

**Data stewardship requirements**: Institutions with specific data residency requirements or long-term archival requirements may need different infrastructure approaches.

**Multi-site coordination**: Multi-site studies benefit from centralized, web-accessible data management systems regardless of whether infrastructure is vendor-managed or investigator-managed.

**Integration with existing systems**: Some research programs integrate EDC data directly with analysis workflows, requiring flexibility in data export and access.

## Comparing EDC Approaches

| Approach | Strengths | Tradeoffs |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Commercial EDC (REDCap, Medidata) | Polished interface, vendor support, comprehensive training | Annual licensing costs, data in vendor infrastructure, vendor lock-in for exports |
| Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) | Minimal cost, familiar tools | Limited validation, poor audit trails, compliance challenges |
| Homebrew databases (Access, FileMaker) | Full customization, low cost | Requires technical expertise, security challenges, poor scalability |
| Custom R/Shiny apps | Maximum flexibility, integration with analysis | Requires ongoing development, no pre-built compliance features |
| Open-source EDC (ZZedc, OpenClinica) | Open source, standard data formats, lower infrastructure costs | Requires technical setup, community-based support, ongoing maintenance responsibility |

# Introducing ZZedc

ZZedc is an open-source electronic data capture system built with R and Shiny. It provides an alternative approach to commercial EDC systems by emphasizing investigator-controlled deployment and standard data formats.

## Technical Approach

**Investigator-managed infrastructure**: ZZedc can run on infrastructure you control—personal laptops, institutional servers, or cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). This differs from vendor-managed systems where infrastructure decisions are made by the EDC company.

**Standard data formats**: Uses SQLite databases, which are documented, widely supported, and don't require proprietary tools for access or export. This differs from commercial systems with proprietary data structures.

**Open source model**: Source code is publicly available on GitHub under open-source license. Users can review code, fork for customization, or hire consultants for modifications—not restricted to vendor-provided services.

**Pre-built security features**: Includes password encryption, HTTPS support, role-based access controls, and audit logging. These are baseline features rather than premium add-ons as with some commercial systems.

**Data integration options**: Supports CSV export and direct database access, facilitating integration with analysis tools and workflows.

## What ZZedc Includes

**Electronic data capture with real-time validation**: Enter study data with immediate field-level validation. No waiting for data manager review.

**Role-based access control**: Five built-in roles (Admin, PI, Coordinator, Data Manager, Monitor) with configurable permissions.

**Comprehensive reporting**: Basic enrollment reports, quality control summaries, and statistical overviews—all built-in, no custom programming.

**Data quality framework**: Automated checks for missing data, outliers, and consistency across visits. Nightly QC runs identify issues early.

**Audit trail and compliance**: Every action is logged with user, timestamp, and change history. Electronic signatures supported for regulatory studies.

**Data export and analysis**: Export to CSV, Excel, SPSS, or R. Integrate with your preferred analysis tool directly.

**User-friendly admin interface**: Create users, manage backups, view audit logs—all from the web interface. No command-line expertise required.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design points:**

- **All infrastructure is standard**: Docker containers, standard web server (Caddy), open-source database (SQLite)
- **No proprietary components**: You're not dependent on any vendor-specific technology
- **Transparent processes**: You can see, audit, and modify every part of the system
- **Portable data**: Your data is in SQLite—you can access it with any SQL tool, analyze it with any tool, migrate it anywhere

## Deployment Paths: Flexibility for Different Needs

ZZedc supports multiple deployment approaches, depending on your scale and technical resources:

### Path 1: Solo Researcher (Local Laptop)
**Best for:** Individual investigators, small pilot studies, initial prototyping

Install on your personal laptop in 10 minutes:
```r
# 1. Install ZZedc package from CRAN
install.packages("zzedc")

# 2. Initialize project with interactive setup
library(zzedc)
zzedc::init()  # Answers 15 simple questions

# 3. Launch
launch_zzedc()
# Application opens in browser at http://localhost:3838
```

Data lives in a local SQLite file (`data/zzedc.db`). You're the only user. Backup by copying the file to cloud storage.

**Cost**: Free (only your laptop electricity)
**Maintenance**: Minimal (you run it when needed)

### Path 2: Team Research (Single AWS Server)
**Best for:** Research team at single institution, collaborative multi-site trial

Deploy on AWS EC2 in ~15 minutes:
```bash
# 1. Install AWS CLI, configure credentials

# 2. Run deployment script
./aws_setup.sh \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --study-name "Depression Treatment Trial" \
  --study-id "DEPR-2025-001" \
  --admin-password "SecurePass123!" \
  --domain trial.example.org \
  --instance-type t3.medium
```

Application runs on AWS infrastructure. Multiple team members access via HTTPS. Database backed up automatically.

**Cost**: ~$30-50/month for EC2 instance (or less, depending on size)
**Maintenance**: Basic (Docker handles updates, Caddy handles HTTPS renewal)

### Path 3: Enterprise/Multi-Site
**Best for:** Large NIH-funded studies, pharmaceutical trials, production deployments

Deploy across multiple AWS availability zones with load balancing, RDS database, S3 backup, CloudWatch monitoring.

**Cost**: $200-500/month depending on data volume
**Maintenance**: Automated (infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipeline)

## Security and Compliance Considerations

ZZedc includes several security features relevant to regulatory compliance, though users remain responsible for validating that implementations meet their institutional requirements:

**Data governance features**:
- User access logging with timestamps and action records
- Role-based access control with granular permission assignment
- Data export capabilities supporting data subject access requests
- Password encryption and session management

**Technical security**:
- HTTPS support with automatic certificate management via Let's Encrypt
- Database encryption options
- Session timeout controls to prevent unauthorized access

**Audit and validation**:
- System maintains audit logs of user actions and data modifications
- Users can configure validation rules for their specific compliance requirements
- Export capabilities for regulatory documentation

**Important note**: Regulatory compliance (GDPR, 21 CFR Part 11, etc.) depends on implementation context, institutional policies, and validation within your specific regulatory environment. Users implementing ZZedc should coordinate with their institutional compliance and IT teams to ensure implementations meet regulatory requirements.

# Deployment Scenarios and Examples

## Scenario 1: Solo Researcher Prototype

**Dr. Jane is a clinical psychologist** planning a small depression treatment study. She wants to test intervention feasibility before seeking NIH funding.

**Her approach:**
```r
# Install on her laptop
install.packages("zzedc")
library(zzedc)

# Quick setup (5 minutes of questions)
zzedc::init()
# - Study name: "Depression CBT Pilot"
# - Target enrollment: 20
# - Admin username: jane_smith
# - Password: (secure password)

# Launch
launch_zzedc()
# App opens at http://localhost:3838
```

**Result**: Jane has a secure, validated EDC system running locally. She can:
- Create forms for baseline, weekly, and endpoint visits
- Enroll patients and enter data
- Generate enrollment reports
- Export data to Excel for analysis
- Back up by copying a single file to Dropbox

**Direct infrastructure cost**: $0 (uses existing laptop)
**Indirect costs**: Staff time for system administration, backup management, security updates (estimated 2-4 hours/month for solo study)
**Timeline**: 15 minutes for initial setup; ongoing maintenance required

---

## Scenario 2: Multi-Site Trial Migration

**The ADHD research consortium** at 5 universities currently uses an expensive commercial EDC that costs $40K/year and is inflexible. They want to migrate to something more affordable and customizable.

**Their approach:**
```bash
# IT staff deploys to AWS
./aws_setup.sh \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --study-name "Multisite ADHD Trial" \
  --study-id "ADHD-MULTI-2025" \
  --admin-password "SecurePassword123!" \
  --domain adhd-trial.org \
  --instance-type t3.large  # Larger instance for multi-site
```

**Result**:
- Single centralized instance accessible from all 5 sites
- HTTPS with automatic security certificates
- Role-based access: 2 administrators, 5 principal investigators, 20 coordinators, 5 data managers
- Data shared securely across institutions

**Direct infrastructure cost**: ~$40-80/month (AWS EC2 instance + storage)
**Indirect costs**: Staff time for deployment (~20-40 hours initial setup), ongoing administration and monitoring (~5-10 hours/month), security patching, backup procedures
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks from decision to enrollment (including infrastructure setup, DNS configuration, user provisioning)
**Total cost of ownership**: Infrastructure + estimated 100-200 hours/year staff time. Comparative to commercial EDC depends on local staff costs vs. vendor licensing.

---

## Scenario 3: Individual Investigator Independence

**Dr. Robert** was running a study with a local Biostatistics Lab that managed his EDC. The lab relationship deteriorated due to cost escalation and support issues. He wants to take control.

**The situation**:
- His data is in a commercial EDC (vendor owns the data format)
- Migration would cost $20K to export and reformat
- He needs a system that's independent from any vendor
- He has basic IT skills but doesn't want to manage Linux servers

**His solution**:
1. **Deploy ZZedc independently** on AWS (not through the Biostatistics Lab)
   ```bash
   ./aws_setup.sh --region us-west-1 --study-name "Robert's Study" \
     --study-id "ROBERT-2025" --domain robert-study.org
   ```

2. **Migrate his data** from the old system to ZZedc
   - Old system exports to CSV
   - CSV imported into ZZedc
   - Data is now in standard SQLite format

3. **Complete his study independently**
   - Data entry continues in ZZedc
   - Analysis done with R/Python (direct database access)
   - Final data archived as standard database file

4. **End of study**
   - Data archived in standard SQLite format to institutional repository
   - System shut down (delete EC2 instance)
   - Ongoing data access requires only free SQLite tools

**Result**: Dr. Robert owns his data and system. If he wants to work with another Biostatistics Lab in the future, he can—without vendor lock-in.

# Conclusion

This post examined investigator-managed EDC deployment using ZZedc as a case study. Open-source EDC systems represent a distinct approach to clinical research data management with different tradeoffs than commercial systems.

**ZZedc may be suitable if your research program**:
- Requires investigator control of data infrastructure
- Has technical staff available for deployment and maintenance
- Needs customization beyond commercial system data dictionaries
- Prioritizes standard data formats for long-term data stewardship
- Has cost constraints that favor lower licensing fees over vendor support

**ZZedc may not be suitable if your program**:
- Needs vendor support and SLAs
- Lacks technical staff for infrastructure management
- Prefers point-and-click configuration without technical knowledge
- Requires regulatory compliance consulting beyond implementation
- Operates with limited budgets for ongoing system administration

**Total cost of ownership** includes both infrastructure costs and staff time. The financial comparison between investigator-managed and vendor-managed systems depends on your specific local costs, technical capacity, and support requirements.
